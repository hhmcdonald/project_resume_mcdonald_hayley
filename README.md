## Resources

* [Tooltipster plugin](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/) - I used this as one of my jQuery plugins. I applied the hover styling on the h4s in my Employment and Education sections. I used this to add a bit more information for my readers (potential employers) so as to not clutter the page but also give them a fun surprise to find more information throughout the page.

* [Using jQuery Core](https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/) - I used this as a reference to make sure I set up my jQuery file correctly.

* [scrollUp jQuery plugin](https://markgoodyear.com/2013/01/scrollup-jquery-plugin/) - This is the second plugin I used for this assignment. Since it was a single page, I decided a functioning "back to top" button would be a useful addition to the page. So I found this great plugin with an arrow image I liked and implemented it on the page with minimal issues.

## Comments

I really enjoyed this project. It brought everything we have been learning all semester together into one fun project. I can see now how all the pieces of our previous homeworks fit together.

I designed this page for mobile first by giving it very scrollable, easy to access content throughout. I know with resumes especially, the more to-the-point you can be, the better. So I wanted to make sure even if a potential employer came to this site and spent less that a minute on it, he or she could still see the essentials in an organized, stylish and functional way on their phone or desktop. I used pops of color from the image to add detail on the page and kept the typography style modern and minimal.

One question I had was about the tooltipster plugin. I wondered if using the tooltipster function to add more content to the page was effective. I debated to add something on the page that told users to hover on certain areas, but I couldn't figure out how to do that subtle enough. So I just left it as a surprise for people who found it. But I wondered if that was smart or not.
